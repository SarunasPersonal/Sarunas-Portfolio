            <h4>September</h4>
            <p class="text-center">
            As I started studying in the end of September, we delved into three subjects: IoT, Networking, and Programming. I enjoyed programming and IoT the most. We had a good introduction to IoT, and Ben, the tutor, also introduced us to Python. Later on, we learned about the steps to design an IoT device. Programming was a bit difficult for me because we started with C#. I had never used C# in the past, but gradually I learned more about it.
            
            We started networking with an introduction to PC hardware.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>First half of October</h4>
            <p class="text-center">I started delving into the world of programming with C#. Throughout my learning journey, I acquired knowledge about loops, arrays, and other data structures. However, I found loops to be a bit challenging, and it took me some time to fully grasp their concepts.
                In the networking unit, we began utilizing a software called PacketTracer, which completely amazed me. It's a free software that I downloaded at home, enabling me to simulate various network configurations. The ability to experiment and visualize networks firsthand was truly captivating.
                Somewhere along the way, my interest in IoT diminished for some reason. Perhaps I became overwhelmed with the demands of other units, diverting my attention from IoT-related topics.
            </p>
            <h4>Second half of October</h4>
            <p class="text-center">My curiosity started growing even more about networking, I learned about LAN extenders which uses home power grid. So I improved my LAN system at home.
                 I enjoyed the practical information I gathered. In programming lesson I was introduced in to bubblesort, and that broke my head. 
                 I was still sturglling with loops concept. I found the IoT part a bit difficult and had to spend some time on it.</p>
                 <h4>Second half of November</h4>
                 <p class="text-center">Assignment time! I got carried away and completely forgot about them. 
                    I ended up delaying the deadlines for far too long, making it extremely difficult to catch up towards the end. I mismanaged my energy and resources, allocating them in the wrong way.
                     Whenever I encountered a challenging task, instead of seeking help, I kept it to myself. This was a critical mistake and ultimately led to my failure.</p>
                <h4>First half of December</h4> 
                <p class="text-center">With the assignments completed, I was finally able to concentrate more on my subjects.
                     In the programming lectures, we delved into the concept of inheritance, and I found it relatively easy to grasp and understand.
                      On the other hand, networking started to pose more challenges than before, especially when it came to implementing VLANs. However, my interest in IoT was reignited.
                       The concept of APIs fascinated me, and I began diving deeper into the topic, eager to explore its possibilities and applications.</p>
                <h4>Christmas Break</h4> 
                <p class="text-center">During the Christmas break I allowed myself to relax, and think less about assignments. I studied all three subjects during the free time.</p>
                <h4>January</h4> 
                <p class="text-center">The assignment deadlines approached, and this time I was more adept at managing my time. I dedicated some study time in December and made progress on the assignments. Whenever I encountered difficulties with a tasks, I proactively sought help from both tutors and peers.</p>
                <h4>February</h4> 
                <p class="text-center">In the middle of January, we were introduced to new units that grabbed my attention and kept me curious throughout February.
                     I particularly enjoyed the web design lectures, where we had interesting tasks to work on during class. Another fascinating topic was databases, and I wasted no time in putting my knowledge into action. 
                    I started creating a database for the products I sell on Etsy. Managing and organizing my stock became a fulfilling project that occupied my time for a while.</p>    
                
                <h4>First half of March</h4> 
                <p class="center-text">By the end of February more assignments were released. 
                    I really liked the web design assignment in particular. I was able to refresh my graphic design knowledge I gained in the past. 
                    That occupied my head for through the march. </p>
                    <h4>Second half of March</h4>
                    
<p class="center-text">During the web development lectures, I learned about the Bootstrap framework, which got me really interested. I ended up diving deep into it, doing a lot of research. This led me to start creating simple websites using Bootstrap.
    Having a solid understanding of databases allowed me to upgrade my database. I added more tables, which improved my ability to manage the stock of my Etsy store effectively. I also explored the world of Data Flow Modeling and Diagrams. 
    To my surprise, I realized that there was much more to learn than I initially thought, and it required me to relearn some concepts.<br>
    Overall, these experiences have been both challenging and rewarding, pushing me to expand my knowledge and skills in web development and database management.</p>
<h4>May</h4>
<p class="text-center">May was the toughest month for me. I found myself spending an excessive amount of time on assignments, struggling to balance my workload.
     Unfortunately, I couldn't dedicate enough time and energy to complete them effectively.
      I made the mistake of assuming that I had enough knowledge to complete a web design assignment in just a few days, but I was proven wrong. Once again, 
      I procrastinated until the last minute, causing unnecessary stress as the deadlines approached.</p>
